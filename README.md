In this project, I developed a machine learning model using Python to predict house prices using a dataset obtained from Kaggle. The project leverages Python's powerful libraries including TensorFlow, Keras, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pandas to create, train, and evaluate a sequential neural network model. The primary objective was to accurately estimate house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other relevant factors.

The project workflow included the following steps:
Data Preprocessing: Utilized Pandas for data cleaning and preprocessing, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted using Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize the distribution and relationships within the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Applied techniques to select and create relevant features that improve model performance. Normalized the data to ensure consistency and better model convergence.
Model Development: Built a sequential neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture included multiple dense layers with appropriate activation functions and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
Model Training: Trained the model using the training dataset, with a validation split to monitor the model's performance on unseen data. Used callbacks to optimize the training process, such as early stopping to prevent overfitting.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE). Visualized the model's performance and loss curves using Matplotlib to ensure proper training.
Prediction: Used the trained model to predict house prices on the test dataset. Compared the predicted prices with the actual prices to assess the model's accuracy.

The outcome of the project was a well-tuned machine learning model capable of predicting house prices with a high degree of accuracy.

The sequential model demonstrated strong predictive performance, effectively capturing the complex relationships between the features and the target variable. 

The evaluation metrics indicated that the model was able to predict house prices with minimal error, validating the approach and the techniques used. 
Key outcomes include: 
High Accuracy: The model achieved a low Mean Absolute Error (MAE), indicating precise predictions. 
Insightful Visualizations: EDA and model performance plots provided clear insights into data trends and model behavior. 
Robust Model: The use of dropout layers and early stopping helped in developing a robust model that generalizes well to unseen data. 
Practical Application: The project demonstrated practical applications of machine learning in real estate, showcasing the potential for predictive analytics in pricing strategies and market analysis. 
Overall, this project highlighted the effective use of Python libraries and machine learning techniques to solve a real-world problem, demonstrating the potential for data-driven decision-making in the housing market.
